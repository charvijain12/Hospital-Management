# Hospital-Management

This is an implementation of a hospital management system, which consists of two classes: Patient and HospitalManager. The Patient class represents a patient with a name and a status (Normal, Urgent, or Super Urgent). The HospitalManager class manages a list of patients, separated by specializations, with methods to add/remove patients, get the next patient, and get printable information about patients. The FrontendManager class is the frontend for interacting with the user, presenting a menu and calling the appropriate methods from the HospitalManager class.
